##

Pose Depot is a project that aims to build a high quality collection of images depicting a variety of poses, each provided from different angles with their corresponding depth, canny, normal and OpenPose versions.
The aim is to provide a comprehensive dataset designed for use with ControlNets in text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, providing an additional layer of control to the image generation process.



The pose collections can be directly downloaded from [Releases](https://github.com/a-lgil/pose-depot/releases), but with ease of exploration in mind, I've created a [webpage](https://a-lgil.github.io/pose-depot/) that allows users to conveniently browse, filter by tags, and view the different collections and their content.
